Mozilla Principles
Mozilla Products Built by us, for the Web
Mozilla is dedicated to keeping the web open and accessible for everyone. To do that we need to empower web creators through projects like Common Voice. As voice technologies proliferate beyond niche applications, we believe they must serve all users equally. That means investing in more languages and accommodating diverse accents and demographics when building and testing voice technologies. Common Voice is a public resource available to everyone and Mozilla teams and developers around the world are already using it on our own projects as well.

Sets the GStreamer pipeline used to encode recordings. It follows the syntax used for gst-launch. The pipeline should have an unconnected sink pad where the recorded video is recorded. It will normally have a unconnected source pad. output from that pad will be written into the output file. However the pipeline can also take care of its own output - this might be used to send the output to an icecast server via shout2send or similar. When unset or set to an empty value, the default pipeline will be used. This is currently 'videorate ! vp8enc quality=10 speed=2 threads=%T ! queue ! webmmux' and records to WEBM using the VP8 codec. %T is used as a placeholder for a guess at the optimal thread count on the system.

{ -brand-full-name } Web-Based Information Services
{ -brand-full-name } is free and open source software, built by a community of thousands from all over the world. There are a few things you should know:

{ -brand-short-name } blocked { $count } trackers over the past week
{ -brand-short-name } clears your search and browsing history when you quit the app or close all Private Browsing tabs and windows. While this doesnt make you anonymous to websites or your internet service provider, it makes it easier to keep what you do online private from anyone else who uses this computer.
{ -brand-short-name } continues to block trackers in Private Windows, but does not keep a record of what was blocked.
{ -brand-short-name } could not download the search plugin from: { $location-url }
{ -brand-short-name } could not install the search plugin from { $location-url } because an engine with the same name already exists.
{ -brand-short-name } has blocked parts of this page that are not secure.
{ -brand-short-name } has determined that the following add-ons are known to cause stability or security problems:
{ -brand-short-name } has just been updated in the background. Click Restart { -brand-short-name } to complete the update.
{ -brand-short-name } is backed by the non-profit Mozilla, which administers a completely open certificate authority (CA) store. The CA store helps ensure that certificate authorities are following best practices for user security.

{ -brand-short-name } stores information about your settings and preferences in your personal profile.
{ -brand-short-name } stores information about your settings, preferences, and other user items in your user profile.
{ -brand-short-name } uses the Mozilla CA store to verify that a connection is secure, rather than certificates supplied by the users operating system. So, if an antivirus program or a network is intercepting a connection with a security certificate issued by a CA that is not in the Mozilla CA store, the connection is considered unsafe.
{ -brand-short-name } will use the same settings as private browsing, and will not remember any history as you browse the Web.
{ -brand-shorter-name } blocks many fingerprinters that secretly gather information about your device and actions to create an advertising profile of you.

However, we cannot guarantee that this information is comprehensive and error-free. For example, the Safe Browsing Service may not identify some risky sites and may identify some safe sites in error and the Location Aware Service all locations returned by our service providers are estimates only and neither we nor our service providers guarantee the accuracy of the locations provided.
